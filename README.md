Current Functionality
Bone Search: Searches for and select a bone once you give it a name
Add Custom Bone - Uses a custom library of boneshapes to quickly improve the visual quality of created rigs
Save Control - Adds a mesh to the custom library of boneshapes (As a json dictionary in a .json file in the addon folder so it can be loaded later on)
Mass Set Constraint Space - Sets constraint spaces on multiple bones at once, you can narrow down the constraints targeted by the type of constraint
Colorize Rig - Colorizes the armature quickly
Weight Hammer - Normalizes skinned vertex location by applying the average of nearby verticies weights
Clear Vertex Weights - I got sick of deleting weights from a single vertex if I accidentally applied multiple groups without deselecting



To Do - Make Rigify and Unreal Library Naming Conventions - Have the ability to pick between specific libraries at large for the base naming conventions (Like how you can select the library in the save bone name button
